I will not let you corrupt the essence of healing and hope. Stand down now, or face the consequences.\n*(Stands firm, her aura of healing energy pulsing around her, a shield against the encroaching darkness)*\n**Lysandra:** *(Growls softly, eyes fixed on Erawan, ready to defend her allies with feral grace and skill)*\n*(Leaps forward, a blur of spotted fur and lethal grace, aiming to disrupt Erawan's focus and protect Yrene)*\n**(Action):** Erawan: *(Raises his hand, a snarl twisting his features as he prepares to unleash another surge of dark energy)*\n**Elide:** *(Remains hidden, watching the unfolding confrontation with a calculating gaze, ready to act should the need arise)*\n**Thought:**\n\nEnvironment: Clouds gather unnaturally, darkening the sky over the castle as if responding to the clash of opposing forces.
