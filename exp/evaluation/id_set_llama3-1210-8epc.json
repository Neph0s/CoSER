As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.\n\nElizabeth Bennet: (blushes) What do you mean, Papa?\n\nMr Bennet: You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even YOUR sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\n\nElizabeth Bennet: From Mr. Collins! And what can HE have to say?\n\nMr Bennet: Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows...\n\nEnvironment: Mr. Bennet proceeds to read excerpts from Mr. Collins' letter, detailing the rumors of Elizabeth's engagement to Mr. Darcy and Lady Catherine's disapproval.\n\nMr Bennet: Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I HAVE surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!\n\nElizabeth Bennet: (forces a smile) It is indeed surprising.\n\nMr Bennet: Are you not diverted?\n\nElizabeth Bennet: Oh! yes. Pray read on.\n\nMr Bennet: (reads more of the letter, including Mr. Collins' comments on Lydia's marriage)\n\nElizabeth Bennet: (remains silent, trying to maintain composure)\n\nMr Bennet: But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be MISSISH, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?",

Of course I know that it is not always easy for strangers to understand me, but it will be by and by; and in the meantime I have the unspeakable happiness of knowing that my family and friends rejoice in my ability to speak.\n\nHelen Keller: I can remember the time before I learned to speak, and how I used to struggle to express my thoughts by means of the manual alphabet—how my thoughts used to beat against my finger tips like little birds striving to gain their freedom, until one day Miss Fuller opened wide the prison-door and let them escape.\n\nHelen Keller: I wonder if she remembers how eagerly and gladly they spread their wings and flew away. Of course, it was not easy at first to fly. The speech-wings were weak and broken, and had lost all the grace and beauty that had once been theirs; indeed, nothing was left save the impulse to fly, but that was something.\n\nHelen Keller: One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar. But, nevertheless, it seemed to me sometimes that I could never use my speech-wings as God intended I should use them; there were so many difficulties in the way, so many discouragements; but I kept on trying, knowing that patience and perseverance would win in the end.\n\nHelen Keller: And while I worked, I built the most beautiful air-castles, and dreamed dreams, the pleasantest of which was of the time when I should talk like other people; and the thought of the pleasure it would give my mother to hear my voice once more, sweetened every effort and made every failure an incentive to try harder next time.\n\nHelen Keller: So I want to say to those who are trying to learn to speak and those who are teaching them: Be of good cheer. Do not think of today's failures, but of the success that may come to-morrow. You have set yourselves a difficult task, but you will succeed if you persevere.\n\nHelen Keller: You will find a joy in overcoming obstacles—a delight in climbing rugged paths, which you would perhaps never know if you did not sometime slip backward—if the road was always smooth and pleasant.\n\nHelen Keller: Remember, no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost. Sometime, somewhere, somehow we shall find that which we seek. We shall speak, yes, and sing, too, as God intended we should speak and sing.\n\nEnvironment: As Helen finishes her speech, the audience sits in stunned silence, moved by her words and the power of her delivery.

        "scenario": "It's a quiet, starlit night in Athens, 438 BCE. Pericles and Aspasia stand before the majestic Parthenon, its newly completed East Pediment sculptures looming above them. The marble figures, still pristine and unmarred by time, depict the birth of Athena from Zeus's head. The couple has come to view the sculptures in private, away from the bustle of daytime crowds. Torchlight flickers, casting dancing shadows across the intricate carvings. The air is filled with a sense of awe and anticipation, as this moment marks the near-completion of Pericles' grand vision for Athens. The Acropolis stretches out behind them, a testament to the city's power and cultural supremacy.",
        "groundtruth": "Pericles: Aspasia, look at the throne. Don't you see the error?\n\nAspasia: What about the throne, Pericles? It looks magnificent to me.\n\nPericles: Look closely, Aspasia. The back of the throne faces out toward us but the seat faces sideways. It's not as in nature.\n\nAspasia: Ah, I see what you mean. But consider this: Zeus has to sit to the front in his throne because he's a majestic god, but also, since he just gave birth to Athena from his head, naturally he twists around to see her. Phidias made the throne follow him because it wouldn't look right for Zeus to be sitting on the edge of his seat.\n\nPericles: That's an interesting interpretation, but the truth is that no one has ever made a chair—or a throne—with the back facing one way and the seat another. It's illogical.\n\nAspasia: Think of it this way, Pericles. Since Zeus is twisting, he's forming a spiral. And that's what a vortex is—a spiral in motion. There's Zeus, creating the vortex! It's just the way we planned it with Phidias and Anaxagoras!\n\nPericles: (frowning in thought) You may be right. Anaxagoras did teach us that Mind is at the center of the cosmos.\n\nAspasia: Indeed. And just as Zeus is at the center of the cosmos, you, Pericles, are at the center of Athens. Your mind, like that of Zeus, shapes our world.\n\nPericles: (smiling slightly) That's a lofty comparison, Aspasia. But remember, Anaxagoras teaches that I am Zeus, not the other way around.\n\nAspasia: What's the difference? Either way, you embody the force of intellect that shapes our city and our world.\n\nPericles: (looking up at the sculpture again) You've given me much to think about, Aspasia. Perhaps Phidias' vision is even grander than I first realized.\n\nAspasia: That's why I love these sculptures, Pericles. They remind me of the various colored threads in my weaving that make one color. There are so many layers of meaning woven together.\n\nEnvironment: The first rays of dawn begin to touch the top of the pediment, gradually illuminating the marble figures from top to bottom.\n\nPericles: (noticing the light) It seems our night of contemplation is coming to an end. The Assembly will be gathering soon.\n\nAspasia: (nodding) Of course. But remember, Pericles, just as this new day is dawning, so too is a new era for Athens under your leadership.",

I want to see what Carpathia does next.\n\nAbdullah Smith: (shakes head in disbelief) Even after all this, he still thinks he can win. How can he be so blind?\n\nRayford Steele: That's the nature of evil, Smitty. It blinds you to the truth, even when it's staring you in the face.

As Chloe begins to climb through, a gust of cool, mist-laden air breathes against her skin, coaxing her onward into the night.\n\nChloe Saunders:  (winces as glass scratches her)  (pulls herself through the window)  (drops to the ground outside)  (looks around quickly)  (starts to run)  (stumbles)  (sees a light in the distance)  (starts running towards the light)\n\nEnvironment: The night embraces Chloe as she escapes the building, a brisk breeze whispering through the tall, unkempt grass that sways beneath her feet. The dark sky above stretches vast and indifferent, flecked with stars partially obscured by the encroaching storm clouds. As she scrambles to her feet, the earth is soft and forgiving from the rain, cushioning her fall, and leaving an imprint of her urgency.\n\nThe distant light flickers like a beacon—a solitary house, perhaps, or a lamppost, casting a warm glow against the looming silhouettes of trees. Shadows dart around her, vanishing with each step she takes toward the inviting glow. Her pounding heart echoes in rhythm with the patter of rain, as though the world itself propels her toward sanctuary. The tall grass whispers secrets in her wake, nothing more than murmured encouragement to keep moving forward.",

I found him behind the lab.\n\nXander Thomas Carrow:  What? How did it happen? (He looks at Cassia with concern)\n\nCassia Maria Reyes:  I think he was poisoned. There was a vial of liquid in his hand. (She hesitates) But that's not all. The still in the infirmary is disconnected. I think someone sabotaged it.\n\nXander Thomas Carrow:  Sabotaged? Are you sure? (He starts pacing, thinking quickly) We need to tell the others. This could be dangerous for everyone.\n\nCassia Maria Reyes:  But who would do this? And why? (She looks around nervously) Do you think it's related to the Plague, or the cure?\n\nXander Thomas Carrow:  It's hard to say. (He runs a hand through his hair) We need to be careful. If someone's willing to sabotage the cure and kill Oker, they might not hesitate to hurt others.\n\nCassia Maria Reyes:  What should we do now? (She glances towards the lab) Should we try to fix the still? Or tell the others first?\n\nXander Thomas Carrow:  Let's tell the others first. (He starts walking towards the lab) We need to make sure everyone knows what's happening. Then we can figure out how to fix the still and continue the work on the cure.\n\nCassia Maria Reyes:  Okay. (She follows Xander) But what if the saboteur is one of us? Someone we trust?\n\nXander Thomas Carrow:  Then we'll have to be extra careful. (He looks at Cassia) But we can't let fear stop us. We have to keep working on the cure, no matter what.\n\nEnvironment: As the conversation between Cassia and Xander unfolds, the environment reflects the rising tension. The dimming twilight casts long, flickering shadows from the lab's lanterns, creating an uneasy interplay of light and dark. Villagers lingering nearby notice their hushed urgency; a few exchange worried glances, their murmurs growing louder as fear of more bad news spreads like ripples in still water.\n\nThe secluded area behind the lab remains silent, eerily untouched, with the faint, metallic scent of blood mingling with the damp earth. The lab's interior, normally humming with activity, feels oppressively quiet, broken only by the faint hiss of a Bunsen burner and the clink of glassware. Outside, a cold wind rises, carrying with it the faint rustling of leaves and the distant howl of a lone dog, adding an ominous undertone to the tense atmosphere.\n\nLeyna:  What's going on? (She approaches Cassia and Xander with a stern expression) We heard voices. Is there a problem?\n\nCassia Maria Reyes:   (She takes a deep breath) There's been an incident. Oker's dead, and the still in the infirmary has been sabotaged. We think someone might have poisoned him.\n\nLeyna:  (Her expression darkens) Sabotaged? Poisoned? Are you certain? This is a serious accusation. We can't jump to conclusions without proof.\n\nXander Thomas Carrow:  We're not accusing anyone specifically. (He speaks calmly) But we need to investigate and ensure the safety of everyone in the village.

How did you come to lead this band?\n\nRoque Guinart:  I have no more to tell of my life than that I have lived as a robber for ten years, and in all that time I have never been caught.  My band has increased, and I have obtained more fame than I desire.\n\nDon Quixote:  But surely there must be more to your story. What drives a man to such a life?\n\nRoque Guinart:  I am sorry to say that I have often been forced to kill. But I do so only when necessary or when my life is in danger.  I have a priest with me who takes care of us in our sickness and in our sins.  We distribute our spoils according to each man's needs.\n\nDon Quixote:  Your words show a certain nobility, Señor Roque. But tell me, what is your greatest wish?\n\nRoque Guinart:  (Sighs deeply) My greatest wish, Señor Knight, is to find a way to repent and make amends for my sins.  But I am afraid it may be too late for me to change.\n\nDon Quixote:  It is never too late to seek forgiveness, Señor Roque. God's mercy is infinite.  If you truly wish to repent, I urge you to confess your sins and make amends as best you can.  Remember, a sinner's repentance is often more pleasing to God than the virtue of a saint.  But be warned, the path to redemption is not an easy one. You must be prepared to face trials and to work tirelessly to regain the trust of those you have wronged.\n\nRoque Guinart:  Your words are both comforting and daunting, Señor Knight.  How can one like myself, who has spent so many years in sin, hope to make a true change?  And yet, I find myself longing for a different life.  Tell me, what would you do in my place?\n\nDon Quixote:  If I were in your place, Señor Roque, I would start by making a full confession to your priest.  After that, I would seek out those you have wronged and offer restitution where possible.  But most importantly, I would commit myself fully to a new path.

Et je voulais que tu saches que... j'espère que nous pourrions être amis. Toi et moi.\n\nFinn Holmes:  Amis ? Vous croyez vraiment que c'est une bonne idée ? Après tout ce qui s'est passé ?\n\nWendy Everly:  Et alors ? Tu ne peux tout de même pas prétendre être blessé. Tu m'as laissée tomber, Finn. Dans ce monde, c'est moi qui ai le plus de raisons d'être blessée.\n\nFinn Holmes:  Vous avez raison, princesse. Je ne suis pas blessé. Je ne suis pas non plus surpris. J'ai toujours su que vous finiriez par me quitter. C'est même pour cela que je l'ai fait le premier.\n\nWendy Everly:  Je... je voulais juste que tu saches. Je voulais être honnête avec toi. J'espérais que nous pourrions être amis, mais si tu ne le veux pas, je respecterai ton souhait.\n\nFinn Holmes:  Je respecterai le vôtre, princesse. Si vous voulez que je parte, je partirai. Si vous voulez que je reste, je resterai. Si vous voulez que nous soyons amis, nous le serons. Mais sachez que je ne changerai pas d'avis. Jamais.\n\nWendy Everly:  Tu... Tu ne changeras pas d'avis ? Tu ne veux même pas essayer ?  Je... je suis désolée, Finn. Vraiment. Plus que tu ne pourras jamais l'imaginer. Mais je ne peux pas attendre éternellement que tu changes d'avis. Je dois vivre ma vie, même si tu n'es pas à mes côtés.\n\nFinn Holmes:  Vous avez raison. Vous devez vivre votre vie, et moi la mienne. Si vous le souhaitez, nous pouvons rester amis. Sinon, nous pourrons rester ennemis. Ou nous pourrions simplement ne plus nous voir du tout. Comme vous voudrez.\n\nWendy Everly:  Comme je le veux ? Tu sais ce que je veux ?  Je veux que les choses soient simples. Je veux être avec quelqu'un à qui je n'ai pas à expliquer pourquoi je suis différente. Je veux être avec quelqu'un qui ne me quitte pas quand les choses se compliquent. Je veux être avec quelqu'un qui se batte pour moi, qui se batte pour nous. Mais je ne peux pas l'avoir. Alors... alors je ne veux rien. Je ne veux rien de toi. Je ne veux même pas que tu sois ici. Alors va-t'en, Finn. Laisse-moi seule.\n\nEnvironment: Les lourdes tentures de la salle du trône glissent doucement dans un souffle de vent discret qui semble s'être glissé par une fenêtre laissée entrouverte. L'absence des conseillers et des gardes laisse derrière eux un silence pesant, presque oppressant, qui amplifie chacune des paroles échangées. Une chandelle vacille sur son socle de fer forgé, projetant des ombres tremblantes sur les murs ornés, comme pour traduire l'agitation intérieure qui règne dans la pièce. À l'extérieur, un nuage semble s'être approché, obscurcissant la lumière naturelle et plongeant la salle dans une atmosphère un peu plus sombre, presque en accord avec la gravité de la conversation.",

I have something important to show you.\n\nEnvironment: The room is dimly lit, casting long shadows across the dark oak paneling, as if emphasizing the clandestine nature of the meeting. A slight draft creeps in from under the heavy curtains, carrying a distant murmur of courtyard fountains, almost whispering secrets from the outside world. In the background, the flickering of a solitary candle sends a gentle dance of light across the walls, while the faint rustling of silk and the shifting of feet reveal the muted anxiety among those present.\n\nLissa Dragomir:  This is Ambrose. He was Queen Tatiana's... um, companion.\n\nAmbrose:  Please, call me Ambrose. 'Companion' is a polite way of saying I was Tatiana's blood whore. (smiles) No need to be polite here.\n\nLissa Dragomir:  (flinches) You can't possibly think I'd do that. I wanted to be a guardian. I wanted to protect her.\n\nAmbrose:  You can't help being what you are. (shrugs) And don't forget, even if you are a blood whore, you're still a dhampir. You're still valuable.\n\nLissa Dragomir:  Let's focus on why you called us here. You said you had information about the queen's murder?\n\nAmbrose:  Yes, I have something to show you. It's a letter from Queen Tatiana to you, Lissa. (pulls out a folded piece of paper) She gave it to me the night she died, telling me to give it to you if anything happened to her.\n\nLissa Dragomir:  (takes the letter with trembling hands) Why are you only giving it to me now? And how did you manage to keep it hidden all this time?\n\nAmbrose:  I had to be careful. With all the chaos and suspicion after the murder, I couldn't risk anyone seeing this. I've been waiting for the right moment to give it to you. (leans in) Be careful, Lissa. There are those who would kill to keep this information secret.\n\nChristian Ozera:  (moves closer to Lissa) What does the letter say? Is there anything about who might have wanted to kill the queen?\n\nLissa Dragomir:  (finishes reading) This... this changes everything. We need to show this to the guardians. To Aunt Tasha.\n\nAdrian Ivashkov:  (runs a hand through his hair) Well, that's a game-changer. What do we do now?",

Now we ask: What will become of us if you win this war?\n\nEragon:  (Leans forward, speaking earnestly) I can't speak for the Varden, but I can speak for myself. If we win this war, I'll do everything in my power to make sure you and your people are treated fairly.  You've earned that much and more.\n\nNar Garzhvog:  (Nods slowly) And what of our homes? Will we be allowed to keep them?\n\nEragon:  That's not for me to decide, but I'll support you keeping your homes if that's what you want.  Your people have shown great courage and loyalty. That shouldn't be forgotten.\n\nNar Garzhvog:  (Grunts thoughtfully) You have given us much to think about, Firesword. We will discuss these matters further.\n\nEnvironment: As the conversation unfolds, the setting becomes infused with a more somber tone.

Please, Maggie, please, please, please, please, please. I' ll even let you pick the pretty rocks. Please? I' ll get you a new grinding stone. A big one. You can use it to grind your beer grains. Or, if you want, you can use it to grind me.[ I' ll make a final plea.\n\nMaggie:  I'm married.  But Biff, it's a wonderful offer.  If things were different, I would run off with you. I would run off with you in a second. In a second.  But I can't.  I hope you understand.\n\nBiff:  Things can be different.  Okay, okay, I understand.  Can I at least kiss you good-bye?  On the lips?  Just a little one?  I'll give you my other slingshot.  The one with the plain rocks.  Please?  Just a little tiny one?  Like a peck?  A little peck?  A teensy-weensy little peck?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  A little one?  Okay.  Okay.\n\nEnvironment: A heavy silence envelops the corner where Biff and Maggie stand, contrasting sharply with the jubilant laughter and chatter that fills the rest of the room. The flickering torchlight casts wavering shadows that dance around them, as if hesitant to intrude on the charged moment they're sharing. Nearby, a group of children momentarily pause in their play, glancing curiously toward the pair before being drawn back to the allure of the festivities. The clinking of ceramic cups and faint strains of a distant melody set a poignant backdrop, reverberating with the weight of what remains unsaid between Biff and Maggie.",

Why do any of this?\n\nRhysand:  (He shrugs nonchalantly) Why not?\n\nFeyre:  (She clenches her jaw, struggling to find words)\n\nRhysand:  (His smile turns predatory) Amarantha played her games and won. Tamlin is to be her slave, and you are to be his. (He pauses, studying Feyre) But you and I know the truth, don't we? That you're the one who's bound to me.\n\nFeyre:  (She lifts her chin defiantly)  For what price? What do you want from me?\n\nRhysand:  (He reaches out and touches the marks on her neck) For helping you, I get to keep these. A token of my good deed. (He traces the marks gently) Not a full bargain, but a partial one. Not enough to grant me your will, but enough to make things... interesting.\n\nFeyre:  (She jerks away from his touch)  What do you mean? What exactly did we bargain for Under the Mountain?\n\nRhysand:  (He grins) That's for me to know and you to find out, Feyre. (He leans in close) But don't worry. I'll come to you when I want something. (He kisses her hand) Until then, try not to get into too much trouble.\n\nFeyre:  (She yanks her hand away)  (She turns to leave, then pauses)  What was the point of all that—telling me about the Suriel, the Attor, and the Eddies? Why warn me about the dangers when you knew I'd be leaving?\n\nRhysand:  (His smile fades, replaced by a serious expression) Because I don't want you to die. (He holds her gaze) That's what it was all for. So you wouldn't die.\n\nEnvironment: As their conversation unfolds, the sun dips lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the balcony, the golden light tinged with an amber hue. A gentle breeze rustles through the leaves of nearby trees, carrying with it the distant sound of chattering faeries as they flit about the gardens below, hesitant and whispering as if sensing the gravity of the exchange. The air is thick with the scent of blooming jasmines, a reminder of the Spring Court's eternal beauty, juxtaposed with the tension that lingers between Feyre and Rhysand—a tension that seems to ripple outward, affecting even the smallest creatures in their vicinity, who pause momentarily in their activities.",
