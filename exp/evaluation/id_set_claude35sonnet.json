I've made a decision about my family's legacy. I want to confront Travis and Victoria. Will you interpret for me?\"\n\nBree Prescott:\n(Bree squeezes Archer's hand reassuringly)\n\"Of course, I'll interpret for you, Archer. I'm here for you, always. Can you tell me more about your decision? I want to understand and support you fully.\"\n\nArcher Hale:\n(Archer smiles warmly, his eyes filled with gratitude)\n\"Thank you, Bree. I've decided to take over the family business. It's time to stop running from my past. I want to make positive changes in town, but I'm nervous about the responsibility. Your support means everything.\"\n\nBree Prescott:\n(Bree leans forward, her eyes shining with admiration and love)\n\"Archer, that's incredible. I'm so proud of you. It's a big step, but you're not alone. I'll be right beside you every step of the way. What changes are you thinking about?\"\n\nArcher Hale:\n(Archer's posture straightens, confidence growing in his eyes)\n\"I want to modernize our businesses, create jobs, and improve community services. Maybe start a program for people with disabilities. It's ambitious, but I think it could really help Pelion. What do you think?\"\n(He looks at Bree expectantly, valuing her opinion)\n\nBree Prescott:\n(Bree's face lights up with excitement and pride)\n\"Archer, that's brilliant! You're going to make such a difference. I love the idea of a program for people with disabilities. Your personal experience will be invaluable.
